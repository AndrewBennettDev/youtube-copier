# YouTube Copier

### Overview

This is a simple Python app for downloading
YouTube Videos to a specified folder. If you
want to use this you will need to update
folder paths for your own system, and of course
you should update the folder names! You might
love coding, tech, and maker videos as much as I
do, but you should name them whatever you want.

### Local Setup

Obviously you will want to have python3 and pip installed,
but you will also want to install PyTube if you have not
already (run a simple `sudo pip install PyTube`). After that
simply clone the repo, use your favorite editor to change the
directories you want to save to, then run `python3 main.py`.
The prompts will guide you through the rest!
